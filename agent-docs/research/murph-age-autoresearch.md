# Murph Age Autoresearch

Last verified: 2026-05-08

## Purpose

This doc is the durable operating rulebook for Murph Age research/autoresearch work.

Murph Age is a research effort toward a calibrated, interpretable health-age signal. The internal research loop should optimize for outcome prediction, generalization, uncertainty, and user-comprehensible attribution. It must not collapse chronological-age mimicry, health prognosis, and intervention actionability into one unchecked score.

## Operating Rule: ReviewGPT Is Not A Permission Clerk

Use ReviewGPT for high-leverage judgment:

- generating or ranking research directions
- critiquing aggregate model results
- reviewing major model, evaluator, feature, benchmark, or source-strategy changes
- reviewing external-validation execution gates
- reviewing source activation, model promotion, or product-facing claim boundaries
- poking holes in scientific reasoning, overfitting risk, leakage risk, and generalization claims

Do not use ReviewGPT to bless obvious local chores:

- handoff checklists
- metadata-only contract cleanup
- queue hygiene
- tab harvesting and stale-tab cleanup
- reducer enum repairs for harmless label drift
- ignored-artifact packaging
- validator readbacks when the rule is already clear
- continuity-ledger updates

For simple local chores, Codex should act directly, keep artifacts narrow, run local validators/readbacks, and record the result.

## Role Split

Codex owns local execution discipline:

- build scripts, validators, manifests, and reviewer packets
- enforce source-rights and privacy guardrails
- keep row values, source bodies, dictionaries, model internals, and private identifiers out of repo artifacts and ReviewGPT packets
- close harvested tabs and avoid duplicate ReviewGPT lanes
- maintain continuity state
- refuse duplicate or overfit-prone loops when prior gates already blocked them

ReviewGPT owns senior scientific critique:

- decide or challenge major research branches
- suggest candidate model/evaluator improvements
- identify missing evidence, leakage, overfitting, and construct-collapse risks
- review aggregate-only results before the loop spends more benchmark budget
- review external-validation or promotion transitions before any source or product boundary changes

## Transition Gates

Use larger transition gates instead of micro-gates.

Preferred gate levels:

- **Direction Gate:** what research/model/source path is worth trying next?
- **Execution Gate:** may a bounded benchmark run execute?
- **Aggregate Results Gate:** what did the aggregate-only results show, and what should change next?
- **Source Activation Gate:** may a new external source move beyond metadata/admin status?
- **Promotion Gate:** is anything strong enough to move toward product-facing behavior?

Avoid asking ReviewGPT for a new gate when the next step is a direct implementation of an already-approved local artifact.

## Model Loop Policy

Autoresearch should be proposal-first.

The loop may propose changes to:

- feature sets
- transforms
- missingness policy
- calibration/evaluator behavior
- model family constraints
- source-priority strategy
- uncertainty and attribution reporting

The loop must not silently mutate:

- locked benchmark definitions
- endpoint definitions
- public-test state
- source activation state
- model promotion state
- product, recommendation, or protocol claims

The loop should avoid repeated NHANES-only tuning unless the proposal is genuinely new and has a clear generalization rationale.

## Source And Privacy Boundary

Unless a future source-specific gate explicitly unlocks more, Murph Age research artifacts may contain only metadata, hashes, aggregate summaries, validator statuses, and non-quoting source-access notes.

They must not contain:

- source bodies, abstracts, table text, codebook prose, or data dictionaries
- row values, participant identifiers, split memberships, predictions, coefficients, calibration parameters, model parameters, or small cells
- controlled rows or controlled-source content
- embeddings of source or row content
- product claims, recommendation claims, protocol claims, or clinical validation claims

ARIC/MESA and similar controlled sources stay inactive until human/institutional access evidence and a later source-activation review exist.

## Current Practical Default

When unsure whether to ask ReviewGPT:

1. If the step changes scientific direction, benchmark execution, external validation, source activation, model promotion, or user-facing claims, ask ReviewGPT.
2. If the step merely implements or packages a previously decided local guardrail, contract, checklist, validator, or ledger update, Codex should do it locally.
3. If the step is local but could leak private data, controlled content, or model internals, add or run a fail-closed validator before proceeding.
