# Device Sync Ingestion Invariants

Last verified: 2026-06-10

## Purpose

These are the load-bearing invariants for how `device-syncd` ingests provider
data through both push (webhook direct-import) and pull (windowed fetch). They
exist because the recurring device-sync defect class was silent data loss: a
path-selection or "usefulness" gate decided *import-vs-skip* and the skip arm
quietly completed without importing or fetching anything.

The ingestion model is now additive: push and pull are complementary, neither
gates the other, and no branch can complete without import-or-fetch. Treat the
five invariants below as constraints that any change to webhook construction,
resource-job execution, or scheduled reconcile must preserve.

These are durable behavioral invariants. The current owning code lives in
`packages/device-syncd/src/providers/junction.ts` (Junction is the reference
implementation and the only push-primary provider today), with the generic
drain/batch service seam in `packages/device-syncd/src/service.ts`.

## Invariants

1. **Pull is a floor, not a fallback.** The scheduled `reconcile`/`backfill`
   pass fires on cadence unconditionally. It is the sole owner of source
   projection (`projectJunctionSources`), so `last_seen_at` stays fresh even
   when only direct imports are happening. Non-floor completions may move
   `nextReconcileAt` only *earlier* (min-only clamp), never later; a stream of
   webhooks can never starve or defer the floor.

2. **Push delivers early; pull guarantees eventually; neither disables the
   other.** A webhook that carries a parseable payload imports inline (early,
   no fetch). The floor still runs later and refetches the same window. Because
   the merge is idempotent (invariant 4), this overlap is free — so there is no
   exclusivity logic deciding which path "wins."

3. **Unknown input degrades to fetch, never to silence.** Any webhook branch
   that has "nothing to import right now" — empty payload, unknown
   discriminator, oversized payload, unconfigured resource with no event-type
   fallback — marks the connection dirty for the floor (a coalescible reconcile
   over the event window). No silent-complete terminal branch exists: every
   webhook branch ends in import, fetch, or a scheduled floor reconcile.

4. **Merge is idempotent on `externalRef.resourceId`.** Core upserts on the
   record's own resource id (the explicit Junction id for summaries;
   resource/source/timestamp for timeseries). Push-then-pull writes overwrite
   the same row, so importing a record more than once — or via a different path —
   is overlap-free. This is what makes invariants 2 and 3 safe, and it is why an
   import-vs-skip optimization is unnecessary: re-fetching is cheap and correct,
   not a correctness risk.

5. **Louder, never quieter.** Drops and skips surface as persisted
   `device-sync.job_failed`/skip metadata. But observability is not recovery:
   the persisted signal exists to explain *why*, while the floor (invariant 1)
   is what actually recovers the data. A change may make ingestion louder
   (more imports, more visible skips); it must never make it quieter (a new
   silent skip, a deferred floor, a gated import).

## Consequences for changes

- Do not reintroduce a usefulness/import-vs-skip gate on the webhook path. The
  downstream normalizer decides meaning; the ingestion layer's only job is to
  import every parseable record under its own resolved source provenance, or
  degrade to the floor.
- Do not add `projectJunctionSources` to the direct-import path. Projection
  rides the floor only, preserving the deliberate `user/providers` decoupling.
- Push-primary cells (Garmin sleep/sleep_cycle, deletions/tombstones) rely on
  inline import being authoritative because REST is stale or empty for them.
  Never remove their inline import "carrier"; the floor fetch is best-effort
  there and may legitimately return empty.
- Per-resource webhook recovery must coalesce on the shared dirty-state key
  (one floor wake per clean→dirty transition), not emit a unique-window job per
  webhook, so bursts do not fight storm-coalescing.
