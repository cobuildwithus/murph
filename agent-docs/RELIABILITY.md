# Reliability

## Current Guardrails

- Keep behavior deterministic and documented as the first modules are added.
- Prefer explicit failure paths and actionable errors over silent fallback behavior.
- Update architecture and verification docs in the same change that introduces new runtime entrypoints.
- Avoid hidden coupling between scripts, docs, and runtime code; document new dependencies in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `agent-docs/references/testing-ci-map.md`.
- Use the concrete runtime contracts first: hosted runner wake/checkpoint behavior lives in `agent-docs/references/hosted-runtime-protocol.md` plus `apps/cloudflare/README.md`; deploy recovery and smoke expectations live in `apps/cloudflare/DEPLOY.md`; local device-sync and assistant daemon retry/control-plane behavior live in their package READMEs and tests.

## Runtime Expectations

- Define startup requirements, health checks, and critical invariants.
- Document retry/idempotency expectations for writes or background work.
- Add tests for failure modes before relying on production-side recovery logic.
- Foreground inbox/parser-backed daemon runs should favor restartable connectors with bounded backoff over permanently dead watch loops, while still keeping low-level restart behavior opt-in and always bounded by the owning abort signal.
- Networked assistant/provider/channel calls should set explicit timeouts, propagate caller abort signals, and only auto-retry request shapes that are replay-safe or rate-limit directed.
- Automatic meal-photo uploads are replay-safe only through the capture id derived by the enrolled installation. Each staging attempt must own a distinct object. Under the per-capture mailbox lock, the first accepted item chooses the canonical object for exact duplicates; later attempts delete only their own losing object. Failed or ambiguous appends must reconcile the mailbox claim before cleanup so they never delete an accepted object's bytes. Web must reject conflicting reuse, re-signal exact mailbox duplicates, lock the hosted member and active sponsorship source rows before rechecking final upload authority, and acknowledge an upload only after private object staging and canonical mailbox append both succeed. Runtime import must check the canonical external reference before writing, verify staged length and SHA-256 before import, and delete staging only through a post-checkpoint effect; cleanup derives the user-namespaced object path without requiring encryption-context rediscovery. After failed cleanup, the R2 lifecycle rule makes staging eligible for asynchronous deletion at 31 days, one day beyond mailbox recovery retention, rather than guaranteeing deletion at that exact age. A missing control client, staged object, write fence, mailbox append, or runtime read is a visible retryable failure rather than a successful setup/upload.
- Tool-enabled assistant provider turns should disable automatic model retries once local side-effecting tools are in play, so bounded assistant/vault operations are never replayed implicitly by transport-layer retry. Bound tool execution failures should be returned to the model as structured tool results so the model can recover inside the same turn instead of aborting the provider turn.
- Clinical Records retrieval is generation-fenced and page-idempotent. A
  server-derived run/page fingerprint deduplicates caller request ids without
  persisting them or page URLs; claim-version compare and swap prevents a
  replaced stale claimant from double-counting, settling, or releasing its
  successor. Completed recovery replays remain bounded and charged without
  incrementing logical page progress. Credential-version compare and swap
  prevents stale refresh failures from clearing a newer token. Preemption
  requeues the same run and preserves page progress. The initial backend lane
  permits one retrieval generation per member/provider connection; retry,
  reconnect, and refresh remain closed until immutable raw references have a
  bounded retention lifecycle.
- Clinical provider calls use manual redirects, 20-second FHIR timeouts,
  15-second token timeouts, bounded streaming reads, 5 MiB/page, 500 provider
  fetch attempts, 32 MiB charged egress/run, and exact-family pagination. The
  full page allowance is reserved before FHIR egress and settled only after a
  valid response; ambiguous provider-side failures retain the full charge. A
  401/invalid-grant requires
  reauthorization, a 403 degrades only the affected family, and retryable
  transport/429/5xx failures do not silently terminalize useful credentials.
- Hosted generated-image turns must fail before the provider call if the runtime platform has no generated-image uploader, and must treat Cloudflare Images upload failure as a structured tool failure rather than silently returning inaccessible media.
- Hosted generated voice memo turns must treat ElevenLabs generation, Linq attachment upload, or Telegram delivery-time generation failures as structured tool or delivery failures. Final Linq and Telegram voice memo sends are not replay-safe unless the provider later documents idempotency for those native voice-message endpoints, so outbox transport idempotency must stay false for voice memo media and retries must follow the confirmation-pending/fail-closed path.
- Hosted clinical-record retrieval is finite by resource-family, page-count, page-size, total-byte, per-page resource-count, and total resource-count caps. Runtime stops with a fixed terminal result before import when a provider page would cross a raw-manifest resource cap. Its durable work identity is the pointer-only mailbox `{runId, generation}`; provider request ids are deterministic within that generation, opaque cursor progress remains web-owned, and foreground preemption leaves the mailbox item retryable without terminalizing the run. Raw pages plus the manifest commit atomically before canonical import, byte-identical replays are idempotent, and conflicting replay bytes fail closed. `authorization-required` is terminalized by web and must not receive a second runtime outcome.
- Cloudflare container and Durable Object RPC methods must be invoked directly on the platform stub, not detached, bound, wrapped, or passed around as ordinary callbacks. Test doubles for hosted runner/container seams should model that direct-call contract so local coverage catches receiver/proxy mistakes before they become accepted-but-stuck runtime work.
- Assistant turns and outbound sends should prefer system-emitted receipts plus idempotent outbox intents over model-authored logs. The receipt trail must stay non-canonical, compact, and safe to inspect through `murph status` / `murph doctor` even when transcripts are partially corrupted.
- Assistant observability and recovery surfaces should stay persisted and replay-safe: diagnostics/status snapshots must tolerate missing files, and fault-injection coverage should exercise retryable provider/delivery/automation failure paths before those recovery hooks are trusted.
- Observability writes (logs, latency traces, diagnostics, metrics) must never block user-facing latency: queue or fire-and-forget them off the reply hot path and flush at invocation end, per the `Foreground Reply Critical Path` invariants in `docs/contracts/00-invariants.md`. Only warn/error crash-tail writes may block, bounded by the process exit backstop.
